This challenge includes designing an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu, using the skills you've learned in Python so far.

## What python-challenge-1 does

The starter code provided includes the code for printing the menu for the customer, which was part of one of your Day 3 activities. You will be adapting this menu to allow customers to place an order, which includes storing the customer's order and printing the receipt with the total price of all items ordered. The starter code includes comments, which you may use as a guide for the steps you need to add.
