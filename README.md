In this challenge, youâ€™ll design an interactive ordering system for a food truck menu, applying the Python skills you've learned so far.

## What python-challenge-1 does

The starter code includes functionality for displaying a menu to the customer. Your task is to adapt this code to allow customers to place orders, store their selections, and generate a receipt showing the total price of all ordered items. Comments in the starter code provide guidance on the steps needed for these additions.

## Application notes
* The developer added features beyond the original requirements, specifically a line item for taxes and a grand total calculation.

Check [v107+ docs](https://restsharp.dev/v107) for more information.
